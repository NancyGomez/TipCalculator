## Notes

Since I have created applications with Android Studio it felt weird having to ctrl drag in order to create code connections. One of the weird things was that in order to undo a connection you have to manually click an x on it in the ui, I figured deleting it in the code meant that in the next run the connection never happened but it doesn't work that way I guess.
